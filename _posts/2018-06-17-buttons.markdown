Make your app or website really hard to use by eliminating as much affordance as possible.

## 1. Dodge clicks with ninja-like stealth
A great way to reduce clicks is to make sure users can’t find the actions available on the page. You can achieve this in a few ways:

### Camouflage buttons to make them blend in
Think your buttons need styling to stand out? Think again! Use the same styles as other elements on the page to be sure no one can find your buttons.

### Hide buttons behind interactions
Don't show your hand too early. Make users hunt for your buttons.

## 2. Always pick the pointer. Always.
Make sure users can't tell the different between hyper-links and buttons. Overriding the browser defaults to make all buttons behave just like links is sure to confuse them.

## 3. Use ambiguous labels
Drive conversions to zero by using nondescript labels on your buttons. 


### Try vague action words
Want to erode trust with your customers? Use labels like `continue`, `next`, or `submit` to cause anxiety before users make decisions.

### Symbols
Design your navigation around a fun guessing game. People love games.

## 4. Don’t offer context for action or decisions
The context around a button could potentially help a user make a decision. Who needs that? 

### Use colors that fit your brand rather than ones that might offer context
It's far more important that a user knows what colors your niece picked out of a hat when you founded the company than it is to help a user understand what action they're taking.

## 5. Use animation
Animation is a great way to make a button really hard to select. 

## 6. Make everything a button
It's important to drive users to every feature you have to offer. Buttons are great for grabbing attention and distracting users from all that other garbage on the page they don't want to read anyway. 

## 7. Don’t worry about states
Buttons can be enabled, disabled, hovered, in focus, or active...but who cares? Your user doesn't need to know the difference.

## 8. Make feedback invisible
Sometimes, when a button is clicked your back-end has work to do. Don't bother telling the user. They can wait patiently. 

## 9. Keep the target area minimal
By decreasing the size of your buttons, you can INCREASE the mistakes your users make. 

## 10. Use all caps
Yelling at users will show them who's boss.
